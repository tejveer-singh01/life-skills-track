### Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few (1 or 2) lines in your own words.

- The video talks about grit, which means having determination. It explains that you can develop determination through a growth mindset. A growth mindset is believing that you can learn and improve skills with practice, and that mistakes are opportunities to learn. With a growth mindset, challenges are easier to handle.


### What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?

- Internal Locus of Control means believing that you can change or accomplish something because of your own actions. It encourages you to keep trying instead of thinking it's impossible or out of your control. The key idea is that believing in your ability to influence outcomes can keep you motivated, while lacking this belief can lead to feeling unmotivated or thinking you can't do it.


### What are the key points mentioned by speaker to build growth mindset (explanation not needed).

- Solving problems helps you believe you can solve any problem. Having a positive mindset grows and leads to an even healthier mindset.


### What are your ideas to take action and build Growth Mindset?

- I believe it's true: actions are what make things happen. If you have determination, you're more likely to take action and increase your chances of success. I once thought of an analogy: any reason, no matter how silly, that makes you act is effective. For example, if I think not eating healthy will summon a ghost, it motivates me to be healthy. So, my advice is to believe strongly in something that drives you to take action.
