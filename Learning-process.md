## What is the Feynman Technique?

Feynman's technique is "If you want to understand something well, explain it". It is a method of learning and understanding complex topics by explaining them in simple words, 
as if teaching to someone else.


## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

I like the idea of using "keys" to switch between different ways of thinking, it's really interesting!


## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Active Mode: When we learn, we picture books, pens, and quiet study settingsâ€”like students taking notes in class.
Diffuse Mode: Our brain links ideas without us noticing, letting our mind roam freely, creating connections all over, not limited to one area.


## According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic

Understand what you're learning.
Don't be afraid of challenges; they help you learn.
Practice and repeat to understand better.


## What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

I will use the Feynman Technique to make hard things easier. I will break it down and explain it simply, finding what I don't get and learning it until I do.
