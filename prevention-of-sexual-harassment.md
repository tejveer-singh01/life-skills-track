# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment means doing things that make someone feel uncomfortable or humiliated in a sexual way. There are three main types of behavior that cause sexual harassment:

### Physical:
* This means doing something physical that makes someone uncomfortable, like touching them inappropriately or blocking their way. Other examples include making sexual gestures, staring, or trying to hug or kiss someone without their permission.

### Visual:
* This involves showing inappropriate pictures, drawings, or messages that are sexual in nature. It can happen through posters, screensavers, cartoons, or messages sent online.

### Verbal:
* This includes using bad words, making comments about someone's body or clothes, telling sexual jokes, or asking for sexual favors. It also involves threats or spreading rumors about someone's personal or sexual life. Repeatedly asking someone out after they've said no is also a form of sexual harassment.


## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If it's a small problem the first time, I'll talk to the person and ask them to stop. If it keeps happening or if it's a big problem, I'll tell the right people at work using the rules they have to stop harassment. If it's really bad, I'll go to the police.

We all need to work together to stop sexual harassment. It's important to tell others about how to stop it so that everyone can feel safe and do their best without being afraid.
