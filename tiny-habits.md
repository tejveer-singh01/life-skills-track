### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

- BJ Fogg found a simple way to understand why people do things: it's a mix of motivation, ability, and prompts (B=MAP).
- The Tiny Habits method helps us make big changes in our life.
- To make new habits stick, start really small. The smaller the habit, the easier it is to do without needing a lot of motivation.
- Use reminders to help you do your new habit. When you finish one task, let it prompt you to do the habit you want.
- Be proud of your small achievements. Celebrate when you complete your tiny habits. This helps them become a permanent part of your life.


### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

B = MAP means Behavior equals Motivation, Ability, and Prompt. It's a basic idea about why people do things. Changing our behavior depends on these three things.First, there's motivation. We need to want to change or do something new. Motivation pushes us to start. Then, there's ability. We need to be able to do the new thing. It has to be possible for us. Lastly, there's the prompt. This is like a reminder or a cue. It helps us remember to do the new behavior. These prompts become stronger over time. The best prompts are actions we already do. When we finish one thing, it can remind us to do our new habit. This makes our tiny habits stick around for a long time.


### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

It's really good to celebrate when you finish a habit. This celebration is super important because it helps us feel proud of what we did. Feeling proud keeps us wanting to do the habit again. When we do the habit many times, it becomes a regular thing we do without thinking. So, celebrating after each time we finish a habit helps it stick in our routine.

- Small improvements add up to big changes over time. Every little bit counts!
- Doing good things with our time makes time work in our favor. But if we do bad things, time can become our enemy.
- Just wanting to do something isn't enough in the long run. We need more than just excitement to achieve our goals.
- Knowing exactly what we want to do is more important than feeling excited about it. Clarity helps us do things better.
- Where we are and who we're with can affect what we do. Our surroundings shape our habits.
- It's more important to do something regularly than to do it perfectly. Doing it often helps us build good habits.
- Once we start doing something good, we shouldn't stop. Keeping the chain unbroken helps us stay motivated and see progress.

### Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

I'd like to read more. To make it a habit, I can leave a book by my bedside (obvious cue), choose interesting books (attractive), set a specific reading time daily (easy), and reward myself after finishing a chapter (satisfying response).


### Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

I want to reduce my social media use. To achieve this, I can hide app icons on my phone (invisible cue), follow accounts that don't interest me (unattractive), set a timer or use apps that limit usage (hard), and remind myself of wasted time whenever I log in (unsatisfying response).
