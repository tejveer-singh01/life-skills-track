## What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

* Avoid getting distracted by your own thoughts
* Try not to interrupt the other person. Let them finish and then respond
* Show your interest in the topics
* Show that you are listening with your body language
* Take notes during important conversations
* Paraphrase what others have said to ensure you are both on the same track



## According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

Reflective listening is an act of understanding the speaker's idea, and then communicating back to the speaker, to confirm the idea has been understood correctly.

Some key points are:
* Repeat what they say to make sure you understand
* Know how they feel, not just what they say
* Listen more, talk less.
* Respond kindly and understand their feelings



## What are the obstacles in your listening process?

Obstacles in my listening process are:

* Lack of patience to listen to someone for a long time
* Some environmental distractions
* Hard to understand different ways people speak or words I don't know.
* Bored during long conversations



## What can you do to improve your listening?

To improve my listening, I can:

* Try hard to listen, even if it's a long talk and be patient
* Find a quiet place to listen and block out noise and distractions
* If I don't understand, I can ask the person to explain again
* Read more to understand new words, so I can understand others better



## When do you switch to a Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?

In everyday situations, I sometimes end up being passive in how I talk to others. This happens when I try really hard to make others happy, even if it means ignoring what I want or need. It can get 
uncomfortable, especially when the other person is important or respected. In those moments, I tend to forget about what I want and just go along with what they say. That's when passive communication happens.



## When do you switch to Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?

I become aggressive in how I talk when I feel like nobody is listening to what I think or need. Also, when I'm really angry, I might start talking aggressively. When I feel ignored or very upset, I tend to become aggressive in how I communicate.
It's like I'm trying to make my point heard, but it might not always work well. Being too forceful can make situations worse.



## When do you switch to passive-aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day-to-day life?


I switch to Passive-aggressive communication styles like sarcasm, gossiping, taunts, or giving silent treatment in my day-to-day life when I feel frustrated or upset but find it hard to express
my feelings directly. When I am unable to communicate my feelings about a specific action, I might use these indirect methods to show my displeasure.



## How can you make your communication assertive? You can watch and analyse the videos, then think about what would be a few steps you can apply in your own life.

* Identifying my real needs and opinions to avoid confusion in communication
* Starting to talk assertively in easy situations and with friends, then trying it in harder ones.
* Talking openly from the beginning for better relationships.
* Be careful about how I talk to avoid being too mean or too quiet.
* Watching how I move and act while talking, so I don't seem mean.
